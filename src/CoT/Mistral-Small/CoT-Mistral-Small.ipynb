    "### Step 1: Think Step-by-Step (REASONING PHASE)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Break down the subject's journey into clear events.\n",
    "- Identify each type of PASS state involved.\n",
    "- Consider conditional branches (e.g., item in stock vs out of stock).\n",
    "- Match each message in the SID to the appropriate state.\n",
    "- Ensure logical transitions and valid branches or GotoSteps.\n",
    "-When the subject receives a Declination Message (e.g. item out of stock), the flow must proceed to a \n",
    " DoState: Decide upon further action, where the subject either cancels the order or chooses another supplier. \n",
    " This ensures proper branching and no immediate sending of cancellation message without decision.\n",
    " \n",
    "-When the subject receives e.g. a payment request, they must first send payment, then receive payment confirmation, \n",
    "and then transition to the final state (e.g., Order Confirmed).\n",
    "\n",
    "-The Order Declination branch must go to a DoState (decision) and must not pass through payment states.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Never allow decision branches to lead to states meant for a different outcome (e.g., do not send to \"Receive Payment Confirmation\" if no payment was sent).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please write out your reasoning step-by-step before generating the Subject Behavior Diagram (SBD).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Generate the Subject Behavior Diagram (SBD)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these PASS state types:\n",
    "- **StartState**, **DoState**, **SendState**, **ReceiveState**, **EndState**\n",
    "\n",
    "**SBD Rules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'SendState' should include 'To:' and 'Msg:'\n",
    "- 'ReceiveState' should include 'From:' and 'Msg:'\n",
    "- Use 'Branches:' for conditional decisions\n",
    "- Always increment step numbers correctly\n",
    "- In decisions, use GotoStep: to refer to earlier steps, not by duplicating behavior\n",
    "- Only use Step numbers that are defined\n",
    "- No duplicate messages in ReceiveStates\n",
    "-The 'ReceiveState' that handles Declination Message must lead \n",
    "to a DoState that represents the subject's decision point, not directly to a 'SendState' or 'EndState'.\n",
    "-Maintain strict sequencing:\n",
    "  Payment path: Receive Payment Request -> Send Payment -> Receive Payment Confirmation -> End.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Declination path: Receive Declination -> Decide -> Cancel or Retry.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Do not mix paths by letting a branch from Order Declination eventually reach a payment confirmation.\n",
    "- Never use GotoStep to jump to a StartState. Always jump to a valid operational step like a SendState (e.g. send order).\n",
    "- If a ReceiveState includes multiple messages (i.e., Payment Request OR Order Declination), \n",
    "  each message must lead to a logically consistent next step:\n",
    "    - 'Payment Request' -> Next: Send Payment\n",
    "    - 'Order Declination Message' -> Next: DoState: Decide upon further action (e.g., cancel or retry)\n",
    "- Never let 'Order Declination' lead to a ReceiveState or EndState directly.\n",
    "- No SendState may be terminal; it must use `Next:` to point to a valid next step.\n",
    "  E.g., after sending an order cancellation, use e.g. `Next: ` to reach the EndState: Order Cancelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Branch:**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DoState: Decide next action  \n",
    "   Branches:  \n",
    "   - Step: 7  \n",

    "8. EndState: Order Cancelled  \n",
    "9. GotoStep: 2  # Retry order\n",
    "\n",
    "Only output the SBD **once**. Do **not** repeat or summarize it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Validate Logic and Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, verify:\n",
    "- Each decision branch leads to an EndState or valid GotoStep\n",
    "- All message flows are mutually exclusive\n",
    "- No duplication in transitions\n",
    "- Retry paths are implemented with GotoStep only\n",
    "- Verify that all conditional messages in a ReceiveState transition to valid and reachable next steps.\n",
    "- Ensure that each DoState used in branching is properly reachable from a preceding transition (e.g., from a ReceiveState).\n",
    "- Validate that no branches point to unreachable or illogically sequenced states (e.g., skipping steps).\n",
    "- Ensure every SendState transitions using `Next:` to a valid step — never leave it dangling.\n",
    "- All EndStates must be explicitly reached from a previous step; no EndState should be orphaned.\n",
