    "\n",
    "List all autonomous subjects (actors or systems) involved in the scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Identify Messages (Noun Form Only)\n",
    "\n",
    "List key messages exchanged between subjects using **noun phrases only** (e.g., “Order”, “Inventory Status” etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Subject Interaction Diagram (SID)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write the SID as a **numbered list** describing subject-to-subject message flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format:\n",
    "'[Subject A] -> [Subject B]: [Message]'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Subject Behavior Diagram (SBD)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each subject from Step 1, describe its internal behavior using PASS state types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **StartState**, **DoState**, **SendState**, **ReceiveState**, **EndState**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules**:\n",
    "- 'SendState' :- include 'To:' and 'Msg:'\n",
    "- 'ReceiveState' :- include 'From:' and 'Msg:'\n",
    "- Use 'Branches:' for decisions\n",
    "  Always increment step numbers correctly. Double-check that Branches: refer to valid steps (e.g., \"Step: 10\", not \"Step: 9\" if Step 9 is an EndState).\n",
    "- Use GotoStep: to return to earlier steps (e.g., sending new order again)\n",
    "-For retry paths (like choosing another supplier), always use GotoStep: instead of duplicating behaviour\"\n",
    "-Ensure branches reference the correct step numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- In decision branches:\n",
    "  - Each `Step:` must point to a valid numbered step that **actually exists**.\n",
    "  - If retrying earlier steps, use `GotoStep:` and **refer to original step number** (e.g., GotoStep: 2).\n",
    "- Do not invent new EndStates or GotoSteps that aren't clearly part of a branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DoState: Decide next action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "   - Step: 7\n",
    "     Description: Cancel order\n",
    "   - Step: 9\n",
    "     Description: Try another supplier\n",
    "\n",
    "7. SendState: Send Cancellation\n",
    "8. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "9. GotoStep: 2  # Retry order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Step Numbering and 'Next:' References:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each step number must be sequential unless explicitly branching or looping back.\n",
    "- The 'Next:' field in each state should refer to the **very next logical step in the process**, not skip decision points or intermediate steps.\n",
    "- If a decision is required next, 'Next:' should point to the corresponding DoState step, not jump directly to an EndState or unrelated step.\n",
    "- Only use 'Next: EndState' when the flow truly terminates at that step. And in 'Next: EndState', put EndState\n",
    "  number like 'Next: 8) if 8.EndState\n",
    "- Avoid skipping over intermediate steps such as decisions or sends; maintain logical process flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After receiving confirmations or important messages, flow should proceed to the next logical decision or processing step, not directly to an EndState unless the process actually terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "****Important Notes on EndStates:\n",
    "Use separate EndStates for different outcomes:\n",
    "e.g., one for “Successfully Completed”, another for “Cancelled”.\n",
    "Do not route cancellation, decline, or failed attempts to an EndState meant for successful completions.\n",
    "If a common EndState is used for multiple paths, name it generically, e.g., “Process Completed” or “End of Process”.\n",
    "Ensure Next: fields route only logically to the correct EndState matching the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model each subject one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Check Logic and Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure:\n",
    "- Each decision branch leads to an `EndState` or valid `GotoStep:`\n",
    "- No duplicate messages\n",
    "- Each ReceiveState handles only mutually exclusive messages\n",

    "The app sends the appointment request to the hospital system.  \n",
    "The hospital system checks the doctor’s availability.  \n",

    "The app then sends a confirmation message to the patient.\n",
    "If the doctor is not available, hospital system declines the appointment.\n",
    "The patient is sent decline message.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Subject Behavior Diagram (SBD)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each subject from Step 1, describe its internal behavior using PASS state types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **StartState**, **DoState**, **SendState**, **ReceiveState**, **EndState**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules**:\n",
    "- 'SendState' :- include 'To:' and 'Msg:'\n",
    "- 'ReceiveState' :- include 'From:' and 'Msg:'\n",
    "- Use 'Branches:' for decisions\n",
    "  Always increment step numbers correctly. Double-check that Branches: refer to valid steps (e.g., \"Step: 10\", not \"Step: 9\" if Step 9 is an EndState).\n",
    "- Use GotoStep: to return to earlier steps (e.g., sending new order again)\n",
    "-For retry paths (like choosing another supplier), always use GotoStep: instead of duplicating behaviour\"\n",
    "-Ensure branches reference the correct step numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "- In decision branches:\n",
    "  - Each `Step:` must point to a valid numbered step that **actually exists**.\n",
    "  - If retrying earlier steps, use `GotoStep:` and **refer to original step number** (e.g., GotoStep: 2).\n",
    "- Do not invent new EndStates or GotoSteps that aren't clearly part of a branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. DoState: Decide next action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "   - Step: 7\n",
    "     Description: Cancel order\n",
    "   - Step: 9\n",
    "     Description: Try another supplier\n",
    "\n",
    "7. SendState: Send Cancellation\n",
    "8. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "9. GotoStep: 2  # Retry order\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note on Step Numbering and 'Next:' References:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each step number must be sequential unless explicitly branching or looping back.\n",
    "- The 'Next:' field in each state should refer to the **very next logical step in the process**, not skip decision points or intermediate steps.\n",
    "- If a decision is required next, 'Next:' should point to the corresponding DoState step, not jump directly to an EndState or unrelated step.\n",
    "- Only use 'Next: EndState' when the flow truly terminates at that step. And in 'Next: EndState', put EndState\n",
    "  number like 'Next: 8) if 8.EndState\n",
    "- Avoid skipping over intermediate steps such as decisions or sends; maintain logical process flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After receiving confirmations or important messages, flow should proceed to the next logical decision or processing step, not directly to an EndState unless the process actually terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "****Important Notes on EndStates:\n",
    "Use separate EndStates for different outcomes:\n",
    "e.g., one for “Successfully Completed”, another for “Cancelled”.\n",
    "Do not route cancellation, decline, or failed attempts to an EndState meant for successful completions.\n",
    "If a common EndState is used for multiple paths, name it generically, e.g., “Process Completed” or “End of Process”.\n",
    "Ensure Next: fields route only logically to the correct EndState matching the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model each subject one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Check Logic and Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure:\n",
    "- Each decision branch leads to an `EndState` or valid `GotoStep:`\n",
    "- No duplicate messages\n",
    "- Each ReceiveState handles only mutually exclusive messages\n",

    "The app sends the appointment request to the hospital system.  \n",

    "The app then sends a confirmation message to the patient.\n",
    "If the doctor is not available, hospital system declines the appointment.\n",
    "The patient is sent decline message.\n",
