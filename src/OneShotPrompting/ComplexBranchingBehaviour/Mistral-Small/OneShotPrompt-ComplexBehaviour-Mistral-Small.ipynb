    "### Rules for the SBD:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each subject, describe their **internal behavior** as a sequence of states.\n",
    "- Use the following state types and label each step explicitly:\n",
    "  - **StartState**: the beginning of the behavior\n",
    "  - **ReceiveState**: receiving a message\n",
    "  - **SendState**: sending a message\n",
    "      - For every **SendState**, include the following two fields on the next lines:\n",
    "      - `To:` — the name of the recipient subject\n",
    "      - `Msg:` — the message being sent, written as a **noun or noun phrase** (e.g., `Order`, `Payment`, `Order Cancellation Request`)\n",
    "\n",
    "      Example:\n",
    "      2. SendState: Send Order to E-commerce Website  \n",
    "         To: E-commerce Website  \n",
    "         Msg: Order\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DoState**: internal processing or logic\n",
    "  - **EndState**: conclusion of the subject's behavior\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Ensure each interaction in the SID maps to a SendState and ReceiveState in the corresponding SBDs.\n",
    "- For every **ReceiveState**, also include the `From:` (sender subject) and `Msg:` (the received noun message) on the next line below it.\n",
    "  - The `Msg:` must be a **noun or noun phrase only**, matching the noun form used in the SID (e.g., \"Order\", \"Appointment Confirmation\").  \n",
    "  - Do **not** use verbs, verb phrases, or action words (e.g., \"send payment\", \"check availability\").\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Control Flow & Branching Logic (Important):\n",
    "- A `DoState` can act as a **decision point**.\n",
    "- If a state has multiple `Branches:`, they represent **mutually exclusive outcomes**, not parallel or sequential steps.\n",
    "- Use `Branches:` to list possible next steps in decision states.\n",
    "- To represent non-linear flow, use `GotoStep:` to explicitly jump back or forward to a specific step.\n",
    "- Do **not** assume that steps are sequential by default—follow the above rules.\n",
    "- End a branch with `EndState` or no further transitions to mark it as terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Use GotoStep: to define non-linear transitions (e.g., retry loops or skipping steps).\n",
    "-A ReceiveState can lead to multiple different outcomes based on the received message.\n",
    "   Use a Choices: block to specify alternative messages and the corresponding next steps.\n",
    "   Each choice must include:\n",
    "     From: — the sender subject\n",
    "     Msg: — the received message (noun phrase)\n",
    "     Next: — the step that follows if that message is received\n",
    "     \n",
    "Clarifications for ReceiveState and Control Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `ReceiveState` with `Choices:` should **not** continue into the next numeric step by default.\n",
    "- The `Next:` field under each `Choice:` is the **only** path to follow.\n",
    "- Ensure each `Next:` maps to a valid step with correct logic. Do **not** assume the next numeric step follows sequentially.\n",
    "- If a message like `Order Declination Message` is received, it should go **directly to the correct decision step** (e.g., Decide upon further action), not to a step meant for confirmations (e.g., Step 5).\n",
    "- Use `GotoStep:` to connect flows clearly after decisions or retries.\n",
    "- Branches in a `DoState` represent **mutually exclusive decisions** and should not be followed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Structural Rules for Valid ReceiveStates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `ReceiveState` should group only messages that are logically possible **at that specific point in the behavior**. Do not mix messages from different process phases or inconsistent branches.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- After a subject has performed a critical action (e.g., sent a payment, confirmed a booking), they should not receive a message that contradicts or invalidates that action (e.g., an order declination after payment).  \n",
    "  - Such contradictory messages should be handled **before** that action was taken — not afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `ReceiveState` must not mix messages from **different sender subjects** that belong to **separate branches of logic**. For example:\n",
    "  - If one message implies success from one subject (e.g., confirmation email from System A)\n",
    "  - And another implies failure from another subject (e.g., declination from System B)\n",
    "  - These should not be in the same `Choices:` block. They should belong to **different ReceiveStates**, based on earlier branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ensure that once a decision or branching has occurred, only the resulting possible messages **from that path** are expected in the next `ReceiveState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a message like `Order Declination` has already been handled in a previous `ReceiveState` as a decision point, it should **not appear again** in later states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Rule: Include Description for StartState and DoState\n",
    "\n",
    "- For every **StartState** and **DoState**, provide a `Description:` line immediately below the step.\n",
    "- This line must concisely describe what causes the state to exit or what condition/decision leads to the next transition.\n",
    "- This helps label the outgoing edge in visual diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. StartState: Decide to place an order  \n",
    "   Description: Customer initiates order process\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DoState: Pick Order\n",
    "  Description: Order picked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural and Control Flow Guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** create redundant ReceiveState steps. If a message is received at multiple points (e.g., \"Order Declination Message\"), handle all logic in the **same ReceiveState step**, using `Choices:` and `Next:`.\n",
    "  - Do **not** repeat the same ReceiveState (e.g., ReceiveState: Receive Reply from E-commerce Website) if some previous Step already handles the same messages.\n",
    "- If a behavior is a repeat (e.g., re-sending the order), do **not** create a new `SendState`.  \n",
    "  - Use `GotoStep:` to return to the original step (e.g., `GotoStep: 2`), rather than creating a redundant step like \"SendState: Send Order for Another Supplier to E-commerce Website\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GotoStep:` should be used for loops (e.g., retrying with another supplier). Avoid creating a new SendState when the action already exists in a previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When listing `Branches:`, each branch should either:\n",
    "  - Lead to an `EndState`, or\n",
    "  - Lead to another state (e.g., `DoState`, `SendState`) and eventually terminate or loop.\n",
    "  \n",
    "###IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "-If the ReceiveState choice is regarding Declination or rejection then next state number should belong to Decide upon further action. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Additional Rules for Correct EndStates and Branching:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using a `DoState` with `Branches:`, each branch must:\n",
    "  - Lead clearly to an `EndState`, OR\n",
    "  - Use a `GotoStep:` to continue the flow elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a branch leads to an intermediate action (like sending a cancellation request), then that action **must be followed explicitly by an `EndState`** unless the flow continues elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** include orphan `EndState` steps that are never referenced via `Next:` or `GotoStep:`. Every `EndState` must be clearly reachable in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may combine a final action and end state if there is no further processing (e.g., \"Send Cancellation Request and terminate\" can be modeled in a single `SendState` followed immediately by `EndState`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When retrying an earlier action (like sending a new order), use `GotoStep:` to return to that earlier state. Do not re-declare the same SendState.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final State Rule:\n",
    "- A single step cannot combine a `SendState` and `EndState`.  \n",
    "- If a final action like sending a cancellation request ends the process:\n",
    "  - Use two steps:\n",
    "    - One `SendState`\n",
    "    - One `EndState` directly after\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  9. SendState: Send Cancellation Request to E-commerce Website  \n",
    "  10. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then reference Step 10 explicitly from any branch or choice that leads there.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Payment Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- After sending a payment, the Customer must wait for a response using a `ReceiveState`.\n",
    "- This `ReceiveState` should include:\n",
    "  - A `Payment Confirmation` message that proceeds to an `EndState` or confirmation step.\n",
    "  - A `Payment Declination` message that leads to a decision point (`DoState`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Ambiguous Transitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not place a `DoState` directly after sending a payment.\n",
    "- A `DoState` is only appropriate after:\n",
    "  - A declination has been received.\n",
    "  - The customer must choose between canceling or retrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retry Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a retry loop is needed, use:\n",
    "  - `GotoStep:` to return to the appropriate order initiation step.\n",
    "- Ensure all retry paths explicitly flow to `GotoStep`, not a dangling step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT Branch Semantics and Retry Detection Rules:\n",
    "-If a Branch has a description that includes any of the following retry-like phrases:\n",
    "\n",
    " -choose another [supplier|hospital|partner]\n",
    " -try again\n",
    " -retry\n",
    " -resend\n",
    " -submit again\n",
    " -place another order\n",
    "\n",
    "Then that branch must lead to a GotoStep pointing to the step where the original send action occurred (e.g., sending the order or request).\n",
    "Do not create a new SendState — reuse the earlier one via GotoStep:.\n",
    "This enables looping retry logic without duplication.\n",
    "These kinds of retry branches should never point to an EndState.\n",
    "If the intent of the branch is to cancel or stop, use a SendState for final communication and then an EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "5. DoState: Decide upon further action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "     - Step: 6  \n",
    "       Description: Cancel order\n",
    "     - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another supplier\n",
    "6. SendState: Send Order Cancellation Request\n",
    "7. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry order loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A step must use **only one state type**: either `SendState`, `ReceiveState`, `DoState`, or `EndState`.\n",
    "- Do not combine `SendState` and `EndState` in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a retry is needed (e.g., choosing another supplier), use a `GotoStep:` to return to the appropriate earlier step (usually where the order is sent).\n",
    "- Do **not** define a `GotoStep:` without referencing it in any branch.\n",
    "- Every GotoStep must be **actually used in a `Branches:` section** of a `DoState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every `GotoStep:` must be referenced explicitly in a decision branch or as a next step in the control flow.\n",
    "- Do not create `GotoStep:` steps that are not reachable from any previous state.\n",
    "- When defining `Branches:` in a `DoState`, ensure that each branch points to a valid next step, including `GotoStep:` steps if needed.\n",
    "- For example, if you define a retry loop as `GotoStep: 2`, ensure the decision branch description points to that step number.\n",
    "- Avoid orphan steps that are unreachable from the flow. Like this below, 8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry appointment loop is referenced explicitly\n",
    "in Step 5 - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another hospital and try again :\n",
    "\n",
    "5. DoState: Decide upon further action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "     - Step: 6  \n",
    "       Description: Cancel appointment request \n",
    "     - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another hospital and try again  \n",
    "6. DoState: Cancel appointment request\n",
    "7  EndState: Appointment request cancelled (end of this path)\n",
    "8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry appointment loop\n",

    "### Use the following format (example based on a healthcare scenario):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "A patient books an appointment using a healthcare app.  \n",
    "The app sends the appointment request to the hospital system.  \n",
    "The hospital system checks the doctor’s availability.  \n",
    "If the doctor is available, it confirms the appointment.  \n",
    "The app then sends a confirmation message to the patient.\n",
    "If the doctor is not available, hospital system declines the appointment.\n",
    "The patient is sent decline message.\n",
    "The patient then decides upon further action either the patient cancels request and all ends\n",
    "or the patient chooses another hospital.\n",

    "8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry appointment loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Step 5 must be the exclusive next step after receiving an \"Appointment Declined\" message. Similarly, in the e-commerce context, if the customer receives an \"Order Declination Message\", it must always go to this decision point, never to a step meant for payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT RULE:\n",
    "If the `Customer` receives an `Declination Message`, it must transition to a `DoState` titled `Decide upon further action`. This state must contain:\n",
    "- A branch to cancel the order (leading to a SendState, then EndState)\n",
    "- A branch to choose another supplier (leading to `GotoStep: 2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under no condition should the `Order Declination Message` lead directly to the payment step or any unrelated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##IMPORTANT:\n",
    "Ensure that state numbering reflects logical flow.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a payment is sent in Step 4, then receiving the payment response must occur immediately after (e.g., in Step 5 or Step 5.x), not at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid placing follow-up states (like payment confirmation) far from their corresponding initiator steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only GotoStep or loops should cause jumps in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to keep closely related actions (send/receive pairs, decision/action results) in proximity and numbered accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, generate the SBD for Customer only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Correction:\n",
    "If the customer chooses to try another supplier, use `GotoStep: 2` (Send Order....) rather than `GotoStep: 3` (Receive Response). The retry loop must start from the original `SendState`, not from the `ReceiveState`.\n",
