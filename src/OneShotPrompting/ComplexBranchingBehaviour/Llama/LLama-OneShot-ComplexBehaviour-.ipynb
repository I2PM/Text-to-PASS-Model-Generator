    "\\\"\\\"\\\"{scenario}\\\"\\\"\\\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to generate a PASS model in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Subject Interaction Diagram (SID):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify all the **subjects** involved.\n",
    "-Step 1: List all subjects explicitly.\n",
    "Before generating any interactions, provide a numbered list of all distinct subjects involved in the scenario.\n",
    "Use only their names (e.g., Customer, Supplier, Warehouse).\n",
    "- Describe their **interactions** using messages in **noun form only** (e.g., \"Order\", \"Inventory Check Request\", \"Confirmation Email\").\n",
    "- Avoid using verbs like “place”, “send”, “check”, or “confirm”.\n",
    "- Use noun phrases that represent the content of the interaction, not the action.\n",
    "- Return the SID as a numbered list of interactions using the format:\n",
    "  Subject A -> Subject B: Message (noun form)\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. Subject Behavior Diagram (SBD):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for the SBD:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each subject, describe their **internal behavior** as a sequence of states.\n",
    "- Use the following state types and label each step explicitly:\n",
    "  - **StartState**: the beginning of the behavior\n",
    "  - **ReceiveState**: receiving a message\n",
    "  - **SendState**: sending a message\n",
    "      - For every **SendState**, include the following two fields on the next lines:\n",
    "      - `To:` — the name of the recipient subject\n",
    "      - `Msg:` — the message being sent, written as a **noun or noun phrase** (e.g., `Order`, `Payment`, `Order Cancellation Request`)\n",
    "\n",
    "      Example:\n",
    "      2. SendState: Send Order to E-commerce Website  \n",
    "         To: E-commerce Website  \n",
    "         Msg: Order\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DoState**: internal processing or logic\n",
    "  - **EndState**: conclusion of the subject's behavior\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Ensure each interaction in the SID maps to a SendState and ReceiveState in the corresponding SBDs.\n",
    "- For every **ReceiveState**, also include the `From:` (sender subject) and `Msg:` (the received noun message) on the next line below it.\n",
    "  - The `Msg:` must be a **noun or noun phrase only**, matching the noun form used in the SID (e.g., \"Order\", \"Appointment Confirmation\").  \n",
    "  - Do **not** use verbs, verb phrases, or action words (e.g., \"send payment\", \"check availability\").\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Control Flow & Branching Logic (Important):\n",
    "- A `DoState` can act as a **decision point**.\n",
    "- If a state has multiple `Branches:`, they represent **mutually exclusive outcomes**, not parallel or sequential steps.\n",
    "- Use `Branches:` to list possible next steps in decision states.\n",
    "- To represent non-linear flow, use `GotoStep:` to explicitly jump back or forward to a specific step.\n",
    "- Do **not** assume that steps are sequential by default—follow the above rules.\n",
    "- End a branch with `EndState` or no further transitions to mark it as terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Use GotoStep: to define non-linear transitions (e.g., retry loops or skipping steps).\n",
    "-A ReceiveState can lead to multiple different outcomes based on the received message.\n",
    "   Use a Choices: block to specify alternative messages and the corresponding next steps.\n",
    "   Each choice must include:\n",
    "     From: — the sender subject\n",
    "     Msg: — the received message (noun phrase)\n",
    "     Next: — the step that follows if that message is received\n",
    "     \n",
    "Clarifications for ReceiveState and Control Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `ReceiveState` with `Choices:` should **not** continue into the next numeric step by default.\n",
    "- The `Next:` field under each `Choice:` is the **only** path to follow.\n",
    "- Ensure each `Next:` maps to a valid step with correct logic. Do **not** assume the next numeric step follows sequentially.\n",
    "- If a message like `Order Declination Message` is received, it should go **directly to the correct decision step** (e.g., Decide upon further action), not to a step meant for confirmations (e.g., Step 5).\n",
    "- Use `GotoStep:` to connect flows clearly after decisions or retries.\n",
    "- Branches in a `DoState` represent **mutually exclusive decisions** and should not be followed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Structural Rules for Valid ReceiveStates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `ReceiveState` should group only messages that are logically possible **at that specific point in the behavior**. Do not mix messages from different process phases or inconsistent branches.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- After a subject has performed a critical action (e.g., sent a payment, confirmed a booking), they should not receive a message that contradicts or invalidates that action (e.g., an order declination after payment).  \n",
    "  - Such contradictory messages should be handled **before** that action was taken — not afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `ReceiveState` must not mix messages from **different sender subjects** that belong to **separate branches of logic**. For example:\n",
    "  - If one message implies success from one subject (e.g., confirmation email from System A)\n",
    "  - And another implies failure from another subject (e.g., declination from System B)\n",
    "  - These should not be in the same `Choices:` block. They should belong to **different ReceiveStates**, based on earlier branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ensure that once a decision or branching has occurred, only the resulting possible messages **from that path** are expected in the next `ReceiveState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a message like `Order Declination` has already been handled in a previous `ReceiveState` as a decision point, it should **not appear again** in later states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Rule: Include Description for StartState and DoState\n",
    "\n",
    "- For every **StartState** and **DoState**, provide a `Description:` line immediately below the step.\n",
    "- This line must concisely describe what causes the state to exit or what condition/decision leads to the next transition.\n",
    "- This helps label the outgoing edge in visual diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. StartState: Decide to place an order  \n",
    "   Description: Customer initiates order process\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DoState: Pick Order\n",
    "  Description: Order picked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural and Control Flow Guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** create redundant ReceiveState steps. If a message is received at multiple points (e.g., \"Order Declination Message\"), handle all logic in the **same ReceiveState step**, using `Choices:` and `Next:`.\n",
    "  - Do **not** repeat the same ReceiveState (e.g., ReceiveState: Receive Reply from E-commerce Website) if some previous Step already handles the same messages.\n",
    "- If a behavior is a repeat (e.g., re-sending the order), do **not** create a new `SendState`.  \n",
    "  - Use `GotoStep:` to return to the original step (e.g., `GotoStep: 2`), rather than creating a redundant step like \"SendState: Send Order for Another Supplier to E-commerce Website\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GotoStep:` should be used for loops (e.g., retrying with another supplier). Avoid creating a new SendState when the action already exists in a previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When listing `Branches:`, each branch should either:\n",
    "  - Lead to an `EndState`, or\n",
    "  - Lead to another state (e.g., `DoState`, `SendState`) and eventually terminate or loop.\n",
    "  \n",
    "###IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "-If the ReceiveState choice is regarding Declination or rejection then next state number should belong to Decide upon further action. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Additional Rules for Correct EndStates and Branching:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using a `DoState` with `Branches:`, each branch must:\n",
    "  - Lead clearly to an `EndState`, OR\n",
    "  - Use a `GotoStep:` to continue the flow elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a branch leads to an intermediate action (like sending a cancellation request), then that action **must be followed explicitly by an `EndState`** unless the flow continues elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** include orphan `EndState` steps that are never referenced via `Next:` or `GotoStep:`. Every `EndState` must be clearly reachable in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may combine a final action and end state if there is no further processing (e.g., \"Send Cancellation Request and terminate\" can be modeled in a single `SendState` followed immediately by `EndState`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When retrying an earlier action (like sending a new order), use `GotoStep:` to return to that earlier state. Do not re-declare the same SendState.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final State Rule:\n",
    "- A single step cannot combine a `SendState` and `EndState`.  \n",
    "- If a final action like sending a cancellation request ends the process:\n",
    "  - Use two steps:\n",
    "    - One `SendState`\n",
    "    - One `EndState` directly after\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  9. SendState: Send Cancellation Request to E-commerce Website  \n",
    "  10. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then reference Step 10 explicitly from any branch or choice that leads there.\n",
    "\n",
    "###ABSOLUTE Next: RULE (HIGHEST PRIORITY):\n",
    "-Every state must explicitly include a Next: line. No exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Next: must always appear immediately under each state (even when sequential).\n",
    "\n",
    "-Next: must point to the next valid step number in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:-\n",
    "3. SendState: Send Order to Supplier\n",
    "   To: Supplier\n",
    "   Msg: Order\n",
    "   Next: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ReceiveState: Receive Order Confirmation from Supplier\n",
    "   From: Supplier\n",
    "   Msg: Order Confirmation\n",
    "   Next: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Payment Behavior(STRICT RULE):\n",
    "\n",
    "- After sending a payment, the Customer must wait for a response using a `ReceiveState`.\n",
    "- This `ReceiveState` should include:\n",
    "  - A `Payment Confirmation` message that proceeds to an `EndState` or confirmation step.\n",
    "  - A `Payment Declination` message that leads to a decision point (`DoState`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-You CANNOT:\n",
    " -Jump directly from Send Payment to DoState\n",
    " -Combine sending a payment and deciding what to do in the same step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Ambiguous Transitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not place a `DoState` directly after sending a payment.\n",
    "- A `DoState` is only appropriate after:\n",
    "  - A declination has been received.\n",
    "  - The customer must choose between canceling or retrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retry Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a retry loop is needed, use:\n",
    "  - `GotoStep:` to return to the appropriate order initiation step.\n",
    "- Ensure all retry paths explicitly flow to `GotoStep`, not a dangling step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT Branch Semantics and Retry Detection Rules:\n",
    "-If a Branch has a description that includes any of the following retry-like phrases:\n",
    "\n",
    " -choose another [supplier|hospital|partner]\n",
    " -try again\n",
    " -retry\n",
    " -resend\n",
    " -submit again\n",
    " -place another order\n",
    "\n",
    "Then that branch must lead to a GotoStep pointing to the step where the original send action occurred (e.g., sending the order or request).\n",
    "Do not create a new SendState — reuse the earlier one via GotoStep:.\n",
    "This enables looping retry logic without duplication.\n",
    "These kinds of retry branches should never point to an EndState.\n",
    "If the intent of the branch is to cancel or stop, use a SendState for final communication and then an EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "5. DoState: Decide upon further action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "     - Step: 6  \n",
    "       Description: Cancel order\n",
    "     - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another supplier\n",
    "6. SendState: Send Order Cancellation Request\n",
    "7. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry order loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A step must use **only one state type**: either `SendState`, `ReceiveState`, `DoState`, or `EndState`.\n",
    "- Do not combine `SendState` and `EndState` in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a retry is needed (e.g., choosing another supplier), use a `GotoStep:` to return to the appropriate earlier step (usually where the order is sent).\n",
    "- Do **not** define a `GotoStep:` without referencing it in any branch.\n",
    "- Every GotoStep must be **actually used in a `Branches:` section** of a `DoState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every `GotoStep:` must be referenced explicitly in a decision branch or as a next step in the control flow.\n",
    "- Do not create `GotoStep:` steps that are not reachable from any previous state.\n",
    "- When defining `Branches:` in a `DoState`, ensure that each branch points to a valid next step, including `GotoStep:` steps if needed.\n",
    "- For example, if you define a retry loop as `GotoStep: 2`, ensure the decision branch description points to that step number.\n",
    "- Avoid orphan steps that are unreachable from the flow. Like this below, 8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry appointment loop is referenced explicitly\n",
    "in Step 5 - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another hospital and try again :\n",
    "\n",
    "5. DoState: Decide upon further action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "     - Step: 6  \n",
    "       Description: Cancel appointment request \n",
    "     - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another hospital and try again  \n",
    "6. DoState: Cancel appointment request\n",
    "7  EndState: Appointment request cancelled (end of this path)\n",
    "8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry appointment loop\n",
    "\n",
    "##IMPORTANT: Global Unique Step Numbering Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "-Each line in the SBD must have a globally unique step number.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Never reuse a number for two different steps, even across branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Numbering must always increase sequentially, without gaps or duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###ABSOLUTE ENDSTATE RULE\n",
    "-Every branch of the behavior must explicitly terminate in a unique EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "-A path that leads to cancellation must end in EndState: Order cancelled.\n",
    "\n",
    "-A path that leads to successful fulfillment must end in EndState: Order confirmed and paid (or the correct success wording).\n",
    "\n",
    "-No branch can skip its own EndState or jump to an unrelated EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Retry loops are the only branches that use GotoStep: and do not end. But if the user finally cancels or succeeds, you must always add a proper EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Do NOT leave a SendState as the last step without an EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Do NOT make a cancellation branch jump to a success EndState, and vice versa.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "A patient books an appointment using a healthcare app.  \n",

    "The hospital system checks the doctor’s availability.  \n",
    "If the doctor is available, it confirms the appointment.  \n",
    "The app then sends a confirmation message to the patient.\n",
    "If the doctor is not available, hospital system declines the appointment.\n",
    "The patient is sent decline message.\n",

    "\n",
    "## IMPORTANT RULE:\n",
    "If the `Customer` receives an `Declination Message`, it must transition to a `DoState` titled `Decide upon further action`. This state must contain:\n",
    "- A branch to cancel the order (leading to a SendState, then EndState)\n",
    "- A branch to choose another supplier (leading to `GotoStep: 2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under no condition should the `Order Declination Message` lead directly to the payment step or any unrelated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "##IMPORTANT:\n",
    "Ensure that state numbering reflects logical flow.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a payment is sent in Step 4, then receiving the payment response must occur immediately after (e.g., in Step 5 or Step 5.x), not at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid placing follow-up states (like payment confirmation) far from their corresponding initiator steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only GotoStep or loops should cause jumps in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to keep closely related actions (send/receive pairs, decision/action results) in proximity and numbered accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Cancellation Branch Sequencing Rule:\n",
    "If a branch description includes \"Cancel order\" (or any cancellation intent), it must:\n",
    "\n",
    "Point to the SendState step that sends the cancellation request (e.g., Step 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "That SendState’s Next: must point to the EndState for cancellation (e.g., Step 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Never point directly from the branch to the EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##No Orphan Step Rule:\n",
    "Every step number must be explicitly referenced in a Next: field, GotoStep:, or Branches: section of a previous step.\n",
    "Steps that are never reached from any earlier step are not allowed.\n",
    "If a message is already handled in a previous ReceiveState (e.g., Order Confirmation Email in Step 5), do not create a new step for receiving it later.\n",
    "All ReceiveState steps must be placed only where they are actually reached in the control flow.\n",

    "- Describe their **interactions** using messages in **noun form only** (e.g., \"Order\", \"Inventory Check Request\", \"Confirmation Email\").\n",
    "- Avoid using verbs like “place”, “send”, “check”, or “confirm”.\n",
    "- Use noun phrases that represent the content of the interaction, not the action.\n",
    "- Return the SID as a numbered list of interactions using the format:\n",
    "  Subject A -> Subject B: Message (noun form)\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2. Subject Behavior Diagram (SBD):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for the SBD:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each subject, describe their **internal behavior** as a sequence of states.\n",
    "- Use the following state types and label each step explicitly:\n",
    "  - **StartState**: the beginning of the behavior\n",
    "  - **ReceiveState**: receiving a message\n",
    "  - **SendState**: sending a message\n",
    "      - For every **SendState**, include the following two fields on the next lines:\n",
    "      - `To:` — the name of the recipient subject\n",
    "      - `Msg:` — the message being sent, written as a **noun or noun phrase** (e.g., `Order`, `Payment`, `Order Cancellation Request`)\n",
    "\n",
    "      Example:\n",
    "      2. SendState: Send Order to E-commerce Website  \n",
    "         To: E-commerce Website  \n",
    "         Msg: Order\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DoState**: internal processing or logic\n",
    "  - **EndState**: conclusion of the subject's behavior\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Ensure each interaction in the SID maps to a SendState and ReceiveState in the corresponding SBDs.\n",
    "- For every **ReceiveState**, also include the `From:` (sender subject) and `Msg:` (the received noun message) on the next line below it.\n",
    "  - The `Msg:` must be a **noun or noun phrase only**, matching the noun form used in the SID (e.g., \"Order\", \"Appointment Confirmation\").  \n",
    "  - Do **not** use verbs, verb phrases, or action words (e.g., \"send payment\", \"check availability\").\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Control Flow & Branching Logic (Important):\n",
    "- A `DoState` can act as a **decision point**.\n",
    "- If a state has multiple `Branches:`, they represent **mutually exclusive outcomes**, not parallel or sequential steps.\n",
    "- Use `Branches:` to list possible next steps in decision states.\n",
    "- To represent non-linear flow, use `GotoStep:` to explicitly jump back or forward to a specific step.\n",
    "- Do **not** assume that steps are sequential by default—follow the above rules.\n",
    "- End a branch with `EndState` or no further transitions to mark it as terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Use GotoStep: to define non-linear transitions (e.g., retry loops or skipping steps).\n",
    "-A ReceiveState can lead to multiple different outcomes based on the received message.\n",
    "   Use a Choices: block to specify alternative messages and the corresponding next steps.\n",
    "   Each choice must include:\n",
    "     From: — the sender subject\n",
    "     Msg: — the received message (noun phrase)\n",
    "     Next: — the step that follows if that message is received\n",
    "     \n",
    "Clarifications for ReceiveState and Control Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `ReceiveState` with `Choices:` should **not** continue into the next numeric step by default.\n",
    "- The `Next:` field under each `Choice:` is the **only** path to follow.\n",
    "- Ensure each `Next:` maps to a valid step with correct logic. Do **not** assume the next numeric step follows sequentially.\n",
    "- If a message like `Order Declination Message` is received, it should go **directly to the correct decision step** (e.g., Decide upon further action), not to a step meant for confirmations (e.g., Step 5).\n",
    "- Use `GotoStep:` to connect flows clearly after decisions or retries.\n",
    "- Branches in a `DoState` represent **mutually exclusive decisions** and should not be followed sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Structural Rules for Valid ReceiveStates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each `ReceiveState` should group only messages that are logically possible **at that specific point in the behavior**. Do not mix messages from different process phases or inconsistent branches.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- After a subject has performed a critical action (e.g., sent a payment, confirmed a booking), they should not receive a message that contradicts or invalidates that action (e.g., an order declination after payment).  \n",
    "  - Such contradictory messages should be handled **before** that action was taken — not afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `ReceiveState` must not mix messages from **different sender subjects** that belong to **separate branches of logic**. For example:\n",
    "  - If one message implies success from one subject (e.g., confirmation email from System A)\n",
    "  - And another implies failure from another subject (e.g., declination from System B)\n",
    "  - These should not be in the same `Choices:` block. They should belong to **different ReceiveStates**, based on earlier branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ensure that once a decision or branching has occurred, only the resulting possible messages **from that path** are expected in the next `ReceiveState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a message like `Order Declination` has already been handled in a previous `ReceiveState` as a decision point, it should **not appear again** in later states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Rule: Include Description for StartState and DoState\n",
    "\n",
    "- For every **StartState** and **DoState**, provide a `Description:` line immediately below the step.\n",
    "- This line must concisely describe what causes the state to exit or what condition/decision leads to the next transition.\n",
    "- This helps label the outgoing edge in visual diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. StartState: Decide to place an order  \n",
    "   Description: Customer initiates order process\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DoState: Pick Order\n",
    "  Description: Order picked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural and Control Flow Guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** create redundant ReceiveState steps. If a message is received at multiple points (e.g., \"Order Declination Message\"), handle all logic in the **same ReceiveState step**, using `Choices:` and `Next:`.\n",
    "  - Do **not** repeat the same ReceiveState (e.g., ReceiveState: Receive Reply from E-commerce Website) if some previous Step already handles the same messages.\n",
    "- If a behavior is a repeat (e.g., re-sending the order), do **not** create a new `SendState`.  \n",
    "  - Use `GotoStep:` to return to the original step (e.g., `GotoStep: 2`), rather than creating a redundant step like \"SendState: Send Order for Another Supplier to E-commerce Website\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GotoStep:` should be used for loops (e.g., retrying with another supplier). Avoid creating a new SendState when the action already exists in a previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When listing `Branches:`, each branch should either:\n",
    "  - Lead to an `EndState`, or\n",
    "  - Lead to another state (e.g., `DoState`, `SendState`) and eventually terminate or loop.\n",
    "  \n",
    "###IMPORTANT:  \n",
    "-If the ReceiveState choice is regarding Declination or rejection then next state number should belong to Decide upon further action. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Additional Rules for Correct EndStates and Branching:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using a `DoState` with `Branches:`, each branch must:\n",
    "  - Lead clearly to an `EndState`, OR\n",
    "  - Use a `GotoStep:` to continue the flow elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a branch leads to an intermediate action (like sending a cancellation request), then that action **must be followed explicitly by an `EndState`** unless the flow continues elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do **not** include orphan `EndState` steps that are never referenced via `Next:` or `GotoStep:`. Every `EndState` must be clearly reachable in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may combine a final action and end state if there is no further processing (e.g., \"Send Cancellation Request and terminate\" can be modeled in a single `SendState` followed immediately by `EndState`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- When retrying an earlier action (like sending a new order), use `GotoStep:` to return to that earlier state. Do not re-declare the same SendState.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final State Rule:\n",
    "- A single step cannot combine a `SendState` and `EndState`.  \n",
    "- If a final action like sending a cancellation request ends the process:\n",
    "  - Use two steps:\n",
    "    - One `SendState`\n",
    "    - One `EndState` directly after\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  9. SendState: Send Cancellation Request to E-commerce Website  \n",
    "  10. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then reference Step 10 explicitly from any branch or choice that leads there.\n",
    "\n",
    "###ABSOLUTE Next: RULE (HIGHEST PRIORITY):\n",
    "-Every state must explicitly include a Next: line. No exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Next: must always appear immediately under each state (even when sequential).\n",
    "\n",
    "-Next: must point to the next valid step number in the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:-\n",
    "3. SendState: Send Order to Supplier\n",
    "   To: Supplier\n",
    "   Msg: Order\n",
    "   Next: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ReceiveState: Receive Order Confirmation from Supplier\n",
    "   From: Supplier\n",
    "   Msg: Order Confirmation\n",
    "   Next: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-Payment Behavior(STRICT RULE):\n",
    "\n",
    "- After sending a payment, the Customer must wait for a response using a `ReceiveState`.\n",
    "- This `ReceiveState` should include:\n",
    "  - A `Payment Confirmation` message that proceeds to an `EndState` or confirmation step.\n",
    "  - A `Payment Declination` message that leads to a decision point (`DoState`).\n",
    "\n",
    "-You CANNOT:\n",
    " -Jump directly from Send Payment to DoState\n",
    " -Combine sending a payment and deciding what to do in the same step\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid Ambiguous Transitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not place a `DoState` directly after sending a payment.\n",
    "- A `DoState` is only appropriate after:\n",
    "  - A declination has been received.\n",
    "  - The customer must choose between canceling or retrying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retry Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a retry loop is needed, use:\n",
    "  - `GotoStep:` to return to the appropriate order initiation step.\n",
    "- Ensure all retry paths explicitly flow to `GotoStep`, not a dangling step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT Branch Semantics and Retry Detection Rules:\n",
    "-If a Branch has a description that includes any of the following retry-like phrases:\n",
    "\n",
    " -choose another [supplier|hospital|partner]\n",
    " -try again\n",
    " -retry\n",
    " -resend\n",
    " -submit again\n",
    " -place another order\n",
    "\n",
    "Then that branch must lead to a GotoStep pointing to the step where the original send action occurred (e.g., sending the order or request).\n",
    "Do not create a new SendState — reuse the earlier one via GotoStep:.\n",
    "This enables looping retry logic without duplication.\n",
    "These kinds of retry branches should never point to an EndState.\n",
    "If the intent of the branch is to cancel or stop, use a SendState for final communication and then an EndState.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "5. DoState: Decide upon further action\n",
    "   Branches:\n",
    "     - Step: 6  \n",
    "       Description: Cancel order\n",
    "     - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another supplier\n",
    "6. SendState: Send Order Cancellation Request\n",
    "7. EndState: Order Cancelled\n",
    "8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry order loop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A step must use **only one state type**: either `SendState`, `ReceiveState`, `DoState`, or `EndState`.\n",
    "- Do not combine `SendState` and `EndState` in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a retry is needed (e.g., choosing another supplier), use a `GotoStep:` to return to the appropriate earlier step (usually where the order is sent).\n",
    "- Do **not** define a `GotoStep:` without referencing it in any branch.\n",
    "- Every GotoStep must be **actually used in a `Branches:` section** of a `DoState`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every `GotoStep:` must be referenced explicitly in a decision branch or as a next step in the control flow.\n",
    "- Do not create `GotoStep:` steps that are not reachable from any previous state.\n",
    "- When defining `Branches:` in a `DoState`, ensure that each branch points to a valid next step, including `GotoStep:` steps if needed.\n",
    "- For example, if you define a retry loop as `GotoStep: 2`, ensure the decision branch description points to that step number.\n",
    "- Avoid orphan steps that are unreachable from the flow. Like this below, 8. GotoStep: 2  # Retry appointment loop is referenced explicitly\n",
    "in Step 5 - Step: 8\n",
    "       Description: Choose another hospital and try again :\n",

    "##IMPORTANT: Global Unique Step Numbering Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "-Each line in the SBD must have a globally unique step number.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Never reuse a number for two different steps, even across branches.\n",

    "-No branch can skip its own EndState or jump to an unrelated EndState.\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If a payment is sent in Step 4, then receiving the payment response must occur immediately after (e.g., in Step 5 or Step 5.x), not at the end.\n",

    "If a branch description includes \"Cancel order\" (or any cancellation intent), it must:\n",
    "\n",
    "Point to the SendState step that sends the cancellation request (e.g., Step 9).\n",

    "##No Orphan Step Rule:\n",
    "Every step number must be explicitly referenced in a Next: field, GotoStep:, or Branches: section of a previous step.\n",
    "Steps that are never reached from any earlier step are not allowed.\n",
    "If a message is already handled in a previous ReceiveState (e.g., Order Confirmation Email in Step 5), do not create a new step for receiving it later.\n",
